0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

## How It Works
1. *Bytecode Creation:* Create a Monty bytecode file containing a sequence of instructions (opcodes) that define operations for the interpreter to execute.

2. *Interpreter:* Crafted with care, the interpreter program reads the bytecode file. It identifies opcodes, triggers associated functions, and manipulates a stack data structure accordingly.

3. *Execution:* Run the interpreter program and provide your Monty bytecode file as input. The interpreter handles the rest â€“ reading instructions, mapping opcodes, and executing operations.

4. *Modular & Flexible:* The interpreter's modular design ensures that bytecode instructions are separate from the logic. This allows you to reuse the interpreter with various Monty bytecode files effortlessly.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/monty-interpreter.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd monty-interpreter`
3. Compile the interpreter: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty`
4. Run your Monty bytecode file: `./monty path/to/your/bytecode_file.m`
